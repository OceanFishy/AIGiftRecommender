# App Requirements: AI Gift Recommendation Engine

## 1. Core Functionality: AI-Powered Gift Recommendation Engine

*   **Objective:** Generate personalized gift ideas for users' contacts.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   Utilize the ChatGPT API as the core engine for brainstorming and generating relevant and creative gift suggestions.
    *   The system must send structured prompts to the ChatGPT API. These prompts will include information extracted from contact notes and event details (e.g., birthday, specific holiday).
    *   The ChatGPT API should be leveraged to process and understand natural language from notes associated with contacts to inform gift selection.
*   **Personalization Factors:**
    *   **Contact's Birthdays:** The app must be able to access and read birthday information from the native Android contacts application.
    *   **Notes from Contacts:** The app must be able to access and read notes associated with contacts in the native Android contacts application. These notes are a primary source for crafting prompts for the ChatGPT API.
    *   **Major Holidays:** The app should be aware of major holidays (e.g., Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day). Users should be able to select which holidays they want to receive recommendations for. Information about the selected holiday must also be included in the prompt to the ChatGPT API.

## 2. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

*   **Gift Presentation:**
    *   Display a curated list of gift recommendations generated by the ChatGPT API.
    *   For each gift, show a short, compelling description. This description could also be refined or summarized by the ChatGPT API or a secondary process.
    *   Provide direct shopping links to purchase the recommended gifts from online retailers. The app will need a strategy to find relevant shopping links for the ChatGPT-generated ideas (this might involve further search queries based on the gift idea).
*   **Contact Integration Display:**
    *   Clearly show upcoming birthdays and holidays for contacts.
    *   Allow users to easily see which contact the gift recommendations are for.
*   **Input/Settings:**
    *   Allow users to manually add or adjust their holiday preferences.
    *   Provide an option for users to manually input interests or gift ideas for contacts if this information is not available in the contact notes. This manually entered information can then be used in prompts to the ChatGPT API.

## 3. Notification System

*   **Timing:** Notify the user two (2) weeks in advance of:
    *   A contact's birthday.
    *   A selected major holiday for which the user wants reminders.
*   **Content:** The notification should remind the user of the upcoming event and ideally provide a shortcut to view gift recommendations for that specific event/contact within the app.

## 4. Technical Requirements

*   **Platform:** Android (Native Mobile Application).
*   **API Integration:** Secure and efficient integration with the ChatGPT API. This includes handling API keys securely and managing API call limits/costs effectively.
*   **Permissions:** The app will require permissions to access the user's contacts (specifically including birthday information and notes associated with contacts).
*   **Data Handling:** Ensure secure and private handling of all user and contact data. Any user data sent to the ChatGPT API must be handled according to OpenAI's usage policies and best practices for data privacy.

## 5. Key Goals

*   Help users find thoughtful and relevant gifts by leveraging the creative power of the ChatGPT API.
*   Reduce the stress associated with remembering birthdays and holidays.
*   Streamline the gift research and purchasing process for the user.
